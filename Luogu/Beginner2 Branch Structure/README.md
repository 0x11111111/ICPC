# Summary

These questions are quite easy, except for a few details which are worth paying attention to, such as formatting skills(separate your numbers using a space or enter) and overflow(long long or even unsigned long long is required to solve this problem because C/C++ does not give an error message when overflow occurs). I spent 2 hours working on them and finally got 11 "Accepted"(AC)s. Be careful with your code and algorithm.
